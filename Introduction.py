# #### Introduction

# The purpose of this project is to implement ETL in Python using Jupyter Notebook and then perform arithmetic operations in SQL. We begin with loading the data from Kaggle into our python script (Extract), after which we clean/"Transform" our data. Once we're satisfied with our clean data, we "Load" it into our SQL Database where we answer some important questions. 
# 
# The goal here is to understand how, in the practical world, businesses can use such a skillset to their advantage. 
# 
# It was a great learning curve for me especially, where I learnt from my mistakes and the problems that I encountered during the whole exercise. I would highly encourage anyone going through this project to critically analyze it and let me know what can be done better.
# 
# Lastly, I would like to thank Ankit for uploading such a valuable tutorial on his Youtube channel: **Ankit Bansal**. You can find many informative videos on his channel in English Language. While most of the code you'll find here is quite similar, I ran into specific problems while trying to load the data into SQL, so I had to apply a different code for it than the tutorial. My SQL version is different than the one being used in the video by Ankit, so it's possible to face some issues during this step. Nevertheless, it was a great learning curve for me while trying to figure out a solution for it, so I wouldn't be discouraged incase you face such a scenario.
